<h2>CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Benchmark</h2>
<div>
<p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems running on x86_64 platforms. This document was tested against Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3</p>
<p>The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user. Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</p>
