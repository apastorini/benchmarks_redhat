<h2>CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Benchmark</h2>
<div>
<p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems running on x86_64 platforms. This document was tested against Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3</p>
<p>The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user. Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</p>

The user file-creation mode mask (            umask

 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             umask
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             umask
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.          </p>

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </p></td>

The user file-creation mode mask (            umask
) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The             umask
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             umask
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             umask
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.          </p>

.  The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default             umask
 by adding the             umask

A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number.

 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             umask
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             umask
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.          </p>

The user file-creation mode mask (            umask
) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The             umask
 modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The             umask
 is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the             umask
 are cleared in the resulting file mode.          </p>
<p>
            umask

The default             umask
 can be set to use the             pam_umask
 module or in a             System Wide Shell Configuration File
.  The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default             umask
 by adding the             umask
 command into a             User Shell Configuration File

The RPM package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the             -V
  for RPM option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The             -V
  option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option:          </p>
<p>
The             rpm -qf
 command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands determines which package the             /bin/bash
 file belongs to:          </p>
<p>
To verify the settings for the package that controls the             /bin/bash
