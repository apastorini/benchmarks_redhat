    Impact: As Snap packages utilizes squashfs as a compressed filesystem, disabling squashfs will cause Snap packages to fail. 
    Snap application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. 
    This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted 
    packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers 
    to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained

    The /var/tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. 
    Temporary file residing in /var/tmp is to be preserved between reboots.
    The reasoning for mounting /var/tmp on a separate partition is as follow.
    Protection from resource exhaustion
    The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files 
    and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up 
    and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var 
    and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details.
    Fine grained control over the mount
    Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. 
    These options limit an attacker’s ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. 
    See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.
    Protection from exploitation
    An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. 
    Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. 
    If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.
    Impact:
    Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, 
    or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. 
    The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations.

    Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is an intrusion detection tool that uses predefined rules to check 
    the integrity of files and directories in the Linux operating system. AIDE has its own database to check the 
    integrity of files and directories.
    AIDE takes a snapshot of files and directories including modification times, permissions, and file hashes which 
    can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to detect modifications to the system.
    By monitoring the filesystem state, compromised files can be detected to prevent or limit the exposure of accidental 
    or malicious misconfigurations or modified binaries.
